This project is a full-stack e-commerce application built with React (frontend) and Node.js/Express (backend). The frontend uses Vite for fast development and Material UI for design. The backend connects to MongoDB for data storage.

Features:

Modern React frontend with Material UI
RESTful API backend with Express
MongoDB database integration
JWT authentication
To run locally, install dependencies in both frontend and backend folders and follow the setup instructions in the README.
